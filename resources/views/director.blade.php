                  <p>I am tremendously proud to lead a dedicated and hardworking team.
                    Our priority is our pupils and our society. My team and I will strive to
                    provide the highest possible standard of education at all times for your
                    child, Insha Allah. We discovered a lack of understanding of religion and
                    its moral teachings in the Islamic youth today and we are poised to solve
                    this problem. I am highly confident of the team we have on ground,
                    their experience and dedication. I ask Allah to be our support and to
                    help us achieve far beyond what you will be expecting as parents.
                    At ACCE, we plan to equip our pupils with essential knowledge and
                    skills for living a pious life in a 21st century world. Our energy is directed
                    towards building in our pupils the confidence to study, understand and
                    apply any subject they have learnt in real life situations, so that they
                    graduate well-informed and can successfully and confidently follow
                    whatever career path they choose in life. We will equally equip pupils
                    with the knowledge of Deen; Quran memorization, Arabic, Adhkar,
                    Tauheed, Fiqhu, Hadeeth, in a way they will have a good understanding
                    of and apply to their daily life.</p>
                    Our main aim is to ensure that all our pupils study in a safe, secure and
                    happy environment at the school and graduate appreciating their high
                    level of achievement.</p>
                    We are also proud of our curriculum; It is broad, balanced and relevant
                    to the needs of all our pupils. At primary education stage, we deliver a
                    formal broad education system, focusing on literacy and numeracy. We
                    also introduce our pupils to a well-designed and comprehensive
                    curriculum of Islamic Religious Knowledge and Information,
                    Communication Technology (ICT).</p>
                    In our secondary school, we have in addition to our curriculum, a skills
                    acquisition content. We believe the 21st century pupil deserves an allround experience and learning should extend beyond the classroom.
                    These include the Al-Ansar Leadership Programme (ALP), Young
                    Journalists, Qur’an Memorisation Masters, Train the Trainers Club
                    (TTC), Young Farmers Club, STEM Club, Young Writers Club, The
                    Duke of Edinburgh’s Award Scheme as well as numerous communitybased projects. These programmes open our pupils’ minds to new
                    experiences, provide opportunities for them to work with professionals
                    in their various fields of expertise and to ultimately develop leadership
                    skills and qualities which are valued by universities, employers and the
                    society.</p>
                    <p>
                    We have zero tolerance for any form of mischief, such as exam
                    malpractice, drug abuse, bullying etc.
                    Lastly, our carefully selected team of Imams offer Islamic pastoral care
                    to our pupils in order to help strengthen their Imaan and knowledge of
                    the Deen in line with the teachings of the Qur’an and Sunnah.
                    We look forward to receiving you and your child in ACCE, Abuja</p>
